Required functions:

- a. For closed-form LSE approach:
    1. Use LU decomposition to find the inverse of , Gauss-Jordan elimination will also be accepted.(A is the design matrix).
    2. Print out the equation of the best fitting line and the error.
- b. For steepest descent method:
    1. UsesteepestdescentwithLSEandL1normtofindthebestfittingline.
    2. Print out the equation of the best fitting line and the error.
- c. For Newton's method:
    1. Please use the method mentioned in the lesson.
    2. Print out the equation of the best fitting line and the error, and compare to LSE.
