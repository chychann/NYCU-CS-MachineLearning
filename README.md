Required functions:
a. For closed-form LSE approach:
    1. Use LU decomposition to find the inverse of , Gauss-Jordan elimination will also be accepted.(A is the design matrix).
    2. Print out the equation of the best fitting line and the error.
b. For steepest descent method:
    1. UsesteepestdescentwithLSEandL1normtofindthebestfittingline. 
    2. Print out the equation of the best fitting line and the error.
    3. reference (hint : Consider using a smaller learning rate.)
c. For Newton's method:
    1. Please use the method mentioned in the lesson.
    2. Print out the equation of the best fitting line and the error, and compare to LSE. d. For visualization:
    1. Please visualize the data points which are the input of program, and the best fitting curve.
    2. It's free to use any existing package.
